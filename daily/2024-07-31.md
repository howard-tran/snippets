Why the counter on start turn don't work!
The problem must be the coly server
- On `startGame` did not fire `startTurn`

When piece move -> fire SkipTurn event -> coly on SkipTurn event return StartTurn event
-  Client doesn't listen to SkipTurn event, just send!

Let's fine tune a little bit
- only signal move piece after dice throw.

dice throw -> 

movepiece = (haveThrowDice, dicePoint)
Let's markdown some point and revise: CD_RMVE_lead_04

Wait, the move piece
