## Working on ludo game project

### Leave, endgame button

CD_RMVE_lead_04
    Working on this one -> UserLeave button, UserEndGame button

What happened when ?

Count number of user in room ?
Slots[i].id == ''

nope we have the function!
func getUserInRoom

What happened when user leave
userLeave -> endGameVote;
Nope, when user leave on purpose we remove that user from the game server

The UI does not make sense, that 2 buttons should be banned from the 1st time
Only available after the game is started

Lock endgame button
- On server only
- Not on client

A bug!
- A client leave does not fire next turn!

### implement a skip countdown

getSkipTurnStatus == true
    present
        skip button
        move button
else
    disable
        skip button
        move button

When do dice throw setSkipTurnStatus ?

move button present -> (haveThrowDiceStatus == true, pointDice1 == true)
